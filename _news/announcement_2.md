Glad to share that our paper, titled "Learn the Switches: Evolving FPGA NoCs with Stall-Free and Backpressure based Routers" has been nominated for the "Stamatis Vassiliadis Memorial" Best Paper Award at FPL 2020. Checkout our paper <a href="/assets/pdf/2020-fpl-hoplite_ml.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Update: Congrats to "LogicNets: Co-Designed Neural Networks", a work by my talented friends and collegues at Xilinx Ireland, Yaman and Michaela, for winning the award. Well deserved!
