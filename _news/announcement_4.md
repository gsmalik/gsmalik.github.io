Glad to announce that our work around distributed Machine Learning for training DNNs using NeuroEvolution, titled "DarwiNN: Efficient Distributed Neuroevolution under Communication Constraints" has been accepted at The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, 2020. A big thanks and congratulations to my co-authors: Lucian Petrica and Michaela Blott (Both at Xilinx Ireland RnD).
