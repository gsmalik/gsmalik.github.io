Happy to announce that our paper about state-of-the-art neural networks for Keyword Spotting applications has been accepted at tinyML, 2021!! In this work we use hardware aware training (HAT) to build new KWS neural networks based on the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) that achieve state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy and low parameter counts. Furthermore we also outperform other general purpose and specialized backends for KWS by 16-24x! Congrats to my fellow collegues at ABR who were integral to this work. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04465" target="_blank">Paper Link</a>!
