Happy to announce that our "Hoplite-ML" work has been accepted in TRETS, one of the most prestigious venues for research related to reconfigurable computing! We overcome pessimism in worst-case routing latency analysis of timing-predictable interconnect workloads by single digit factors. We learn interconnect parameters through a novel evolutionary algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES). We also propose nested learning that learns switch configurations and regulation rates in-tandem. Compared to standalone switch learning, this symbiotic nested learning helps achieve ≈1.5× lower cost constrained latency, ≈3.1× faster individual rates and ≈1.4× faster mean rates. We also evaluate improvements to vanilla NoCs’ routing using only standalone rate learning (no switch learning); with ≈1.6× lower latency across synthetic and real world benchmarks.
